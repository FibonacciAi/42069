        <h1>Stranded NASA Astronauts Keep Holiday Spirit Alive Miles Above Earth</h1>
        <div class="date">December 23, 2024</div>
        
        <p>In a remarkable display of resilience and holiday cheer, NASA astronauts are proving that the Christmas spirit can flourish even 250 miles above Earth's surface.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            What started as an 8-day mission has turned into an unexpected extended stay for Commander <span class="astronaut-name">Sunita "Suni" Williams</span> and partner <span class="astronaut-name">Barry "Butch" Wilmore</span>, who have been orbiting Earth since their spacecraft malfunction in June.
        </div>

        <p>A recently released NASA photograph captures a heartwarming moment aboard the International Space Station (ISS): Williams and fellow astronaut Don Pettit sporting festive red Santa hats while operating ham radio equipment in the Columbus laboratory module.</p>

        <div class="quote">
            "Another day, another sleigh," NASA playfully captioned the image, showcasing the astronauts' unwavering spirits despite their extraordinary circumstances.
        </div>

        <div class="fact-box">
            <h3>Extended Space Stay Timeline:</h3>
            - Original mission: 8 days<br>
            - Current duration: 6+ months<br>
            - Expected return: March/April 2025<br>
            - Reason: Boeing Starliner propulsion system leak
        </div>

        <p>The festive photo sparked intrigue among Earth-bound followers, many questioning how the stranded astronauts acquired their holiday attire. The mystery was solved when it was revealed that the crew had picked up their Christmas gear during their November dock with the ISS, just before Thanksgiving.</p>

        <div class="quote">
            "We're feeling good, working out, eating right," Williams reassured concerned followers. "We have a lot of fun up here, too. So, you know, people are worried about us. Really, don't worry about us."
        </div>

        <p>Their holiday celebrations aren't limited to decorations. The crew enjoyed a full Thanksgiving feast - space-style - complete with dehydrated turkey, cranberry sauce, and apple cobbler, sharing the unique experience with their Russian colleagues aboard the station.</p>

        <p>While their extended stay wasn't part of the original plan, these resilient astronauts are making the most of their unprecedented situation, proving that the human spirit of celebration and adaptation knows no bounds - even in the vastness of space.</p>
