    <h1>Deep Capture Analysis in GME Context</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <h2>Naked Short Selling as a Tool of Suppression</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Deep Capture:</strong> "Naked short selling is a fraud in which Wall Street operators flood the market with phantom stock 
        to manipulate down a company’s share price and destroy the company."
    </p>
    <p>
        This technique is central to retail investors' claims about GME. Phantom shares suppress GME's true value, enabling massive profits for institutions 
        while harming retail investors and the company itself.
    </p>

    <h2>Regulatory Apathy and Complicity</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Deep Capture:</strong> "The SEC knew about these practices for years and not only failed to stop them but often acted in ways that enabled the criminals to expand their schemes."
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite mounting evidence, GME advocates argue that regulatory enforcement remains weak, protecting financial institutions instead of addressing systemic issues.
    </p>

    <h2>Media Complicity</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Deep Capture:</strong> "The media was largely uninterested, or worse, complicit. They portrayed whistleblowers and victims of the fraud as cranks or conspiracy theorists."
    </p>
    <p>
        This resonates deeply with retail investors who have been labeled as speculative gamblers. The media narrative often dismisses retail concerns, protecting the illusion of market efficiency.
    </p>

    <h2>Cycles and Market Timing</h2>
    <p>
        Historical analysis in "Deep Capture" reveals cycles of market manipulation driven by systemic pressures and structural failures. GME's 741, 147, and 55-day cycles align with these recurring patterns, 
        suggesting a larger orchestration tied to synthetic shorts, FTD resets, and institutional positioning.
    </p>
