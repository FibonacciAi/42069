            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The QQQ charts highlight significant moving averages (MAs) as both support and resistance levels. 
                Recent price action suggests that 503.92 has acted as a key support, while MA256 and MA128 represent 
                resistance levels to watch for confirmation of a trend reversal or continuation.

            <h2>Key Moving Averages</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>MA256 - 517.06</h3>
                <p>
                    This moving average acts as a lower resistance level on the current bounce. Traders should watch 
                    for the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Resistance:</strong> If the price fails to break above 517.06, it could signal a continuation 
                        of the downtrend.</li>
                    <li><strong>Breakout Potential:</strong> A move above 517.06 with strong volume could push QQQ 
                        toward higher levels, such as MA128.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>MA128 - 522.92</h3>
                <p>
                    This higher moving average serves as a stronger resistance. Breaking above it may indicate a 
                    trend reversal. Here’s what to consider:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Critical Resistance:</strong> A rejection near this level could mark the end of the bounce 
                        and a potential retest of lower levels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reversal Signal:</strong> A break and close above 522.92 would show strength and could 
                        confirm a bullish reversal.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <h2>Key Support: 503.92</h2>
            <p>
                The recent bounce originated from 503.92, indicating strong buying interest at this level. It’s a key 
                level for risk management:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hard Stop Placement:</strong> Traders entering long positions may use 503.92 as a stop-loss 
                    level to manage downside risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Bearish Breakdown:</strong> A price drop below 503.92 could open the door for further downside 
                    momentum, potentially targeting lower support zones.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                The QQQ hourly chart presents a clear framework for understanding current price dynamics. While the 
                bounce from 503.92 shows potential for a reversal, traders should remain cautious and closely monitor 
                volume and price action around MA256 (517.06) and MA128 (522.92). These levels will likely dictate the 
                next major move.
